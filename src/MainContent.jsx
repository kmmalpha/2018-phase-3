                    <h2>Crowdfunding</h2>
                        <p>In this phase of the PAT, my goal to research and find the necessary information to answer   any questions posed in my previous two phases. My other goal to better a number of the    questions as they did not sufficiently contribute to the main question in the previous phase.  Along with finding the information to answer the posed questions, I will assess and determine    the relevance of the information found and whether it is suitable to use in my main report.    The main target for this investigation is the Government Department, State Security Agency,    Environmental Health and Safety, who is responsible for the overall civilian intelligence  operations.</p>
        
                        <h3>What is Crowdfunding</h3>
                            <p>It is the practice of funding a project by raising money from a large number of  people,  each contributing a relatively small amount, typically via the internet.</p>
        
                        <h3>How to optimise a crowdfunding campaign?</h3>
                            <p>Crowdfunding is hard, and certainly a great deal requires luck, but there is a way   behind    most successful projects. There is a purely empirical approach to show how to   optimize your    video, landing page, rewards, and the optimal length of time for your    campaign.</p>
        
                        <h3>What are the benefits of crowdfunding?</h3>
                            <p>Crowdfunding can be used to great success to bring to life artistic projects, products   for   sale, and personal ventures like fixing up a restaurant or helping a community in   need.</p>
        
                        <h3>Launch a website</h3>
                            <p>Launching a website before starting your crowdfunding campaign is a good idea. Make  sure     you are already on different platforms of social media, e.g. Facebook, Twitter,     Instagram,  Tumblr etc.</p>
        
                        <h3>Plan your campaign</h3>
                            <p>A lot of things can go wrong. The most important include not locking down a  manufacturing    process, underestimating the difficulty of scaling from a prototype,    running out of money  because of you've miscalculated the costs, and underestimating the   success of a campaign,    which increases the level of complications.</p>

                        <h3>Problems in Alexandra</h3>
                            <p>Security is one of the biggest problems faced by the township. It has a high crime rate. </p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2>Main Question</h2>
                        <p>In what ways can money be raised to ensure better security for the residents of Alexandra?</p>
