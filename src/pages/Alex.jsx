                <h2>Location</h2>
		        	<p>Alexandra, informally abbreviated to Alex, is a township in the Gauteng province of South Africa. It forms part of the city of Johanesburg and is located near the upper-class suburb of Sandton. Alexandra is bounded by Wynberg on the west, Marlboro and Kelvin on the north, Kew, Lombardy Easton the south. It is commonly known as "Gomorrah" among local residents. Alexandra is one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Alexandra is situated on the banks of the Jukskei River. In addition to its original, reasonably well-built houses, it also has a large number (estimated at more than 20'000) of informal dwellings or "shacks"</p>
		        <h2>Origins</h2>
		        	<p>The name Alexandra was the name of a farmer's wife who in 1905 transformed his dairy farm into a township and named it after his wife.</p>
