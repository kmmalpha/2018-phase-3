                    <h2>Reasons to avoid Crowdfunding</h2>
				    	<ul type="1">
				    		<li><b>Crowdfunding works best for projects that require relatively small amounts of capital</b></li>
				    			<p>This method of raising money may prove inadequate for larger ventures requiring millions of dollars worth of financing, although it can be done. It doesn't happen often and can be quite challenging. Serious, established businesses should look for other methods of funding. Making a product and distributing it involves costs. It's easier to make wire transfer payments.</p>
				    		<li><b>Lack of prestige</b></li>
				    			<p>While it may be hip for artists and film makers to raise capital in a trendy, technology-driven way, professionals including physicians, doctors, lawyers and others likely would not want it to be known that they posted their business plans online in search of funding.</p>
				    		<li><b>Negative impact on future financing options</b></li>
				    			<p>Companies that issue shares through crowdsourcing ultimately are beholden to large numbers of unsophisticated investors who own tiny stakes in the business. This structure could deter venture capitalists or angel investors leery of investing in a firm that is owned by thousands of inexperienced shareholders.</p>
				    		<li><b>The value of shares sold to investors during a 12-month period cannot exceed 1 million USD (13`424`300,00 ZAR)</b></li>
				    			<p>If an entrepreneur raises $1 million or more through equity crowdfunding, he/she cannot look for additional funding for one year. Otherwise, the business owner must comply with securities registration requirements.</p>
				    		<li><b>What if your project is not "sexy"?</b></li>
				    			<p>While it may be appealing to artistic-minded investors to fund art exhibitions or documentary films, online support for a traditional business's working capital needs will likely be boring. In these occasions, companies are better off securing lines of credit or merchant cash advances.</p>
				    		<li><b>Speed</b></li>
				    			<p>If a business owner needs a lot of money quickly to take advantage of a discount deal on inventory or requires a rapid infusion of cash for a building project, he may not be able to wait for the idea to catch fire on a crowdfunding site. A cash advance or business loan from a bank are better options to make it happen.</p>
				    		<li><b>Potential lawsuits</b></li>
				    			<p>Investors are always expecting returns and some may not be patient a company is not making any profits. Lawsuits arising from unsuccessful business ventures can happen. Complainant may accuse the entrepreneur of things such as fraud, breach of contract or mismanagement. In consideration of the investment relatively involving small amounts of money, it may be prohibited for investor to pursue a lawsuit. The investors can file complaints regulatory enforcement agencies that may lead to government investigations.</p>

                        <h2>Reasons Why Crowdfunding Is the Best Way to Launch Your New Product</h2>
				    	<ul type="1">
				    		<li><b>Tap into a HUGE marketplace that is growing exponentially every year and attract new customers at a fraction of the cost</b></li>
				    			<p>They are vibrant communities filled with potential customers. Most investors want a discount for the product they are investing in. Not only will you see a great cost per acquisition in your marketing efforts, the platform itself will promote your success and drive additional traffic for no additional cost. They are always expecting positive results.</p>
				    			<p>Most tend to share your story with their friends on social media, by that, they heightening the morality of the campaign and value of each customer. They are basically receiving free campaign advertising therefore your marketing product goes further.</p>
				    		<li><b>Validate a new product and improve it with customer feedback</b></li>
				    			<p><b>According to the Council of American Survey Research Association: “US businesses alone spend 6.7 billion dollars each year on market research and 18.9 billion worldwide.”</b></p>
				    			<p>Crowdfunding campaigns are a low risk and low cost way to do market research and prove product growth while seeing some serious revenue in the process. Customers usually ask that lead to product breakthroughs. The nice thing about crowdfunding is your community of investors aka “backers” knowing your product is improving and they are willing to invest their ideas, money, and social reach to ensure the success of your product. Prices for products can change because customer feedback, and many other things too.</p>
				    		<li><b>Generate more revenue with less risk</b></li>
				    			<p>Crowdfunding allows businesses to pre-sell thousands of units in a 30 to 60-day period which helps drive larger volume orders with manufacturers and larger volume orders usually decrease the cost per unit and increases your limit. This is a beautiful prototype because companies can leverage economies of scale by capitalizing on pre-sale orders and reducing their financial risk. All you need is a working prototype and a great marketing plan. This is better because you include your customers in the development of the product and emphasize before investing.</p>
				    		<li><b>Move more products and upsell anything</b></li>
				    			<p>Even after your campaign has ended, that does not mean it is the end of it all. There are still more bigger and opportunities to explore, and things to upsell to your customers. After your campaign has closed and you are finalizing order information, you can reach out to your customers and offer add-ons and accessories for your recently launched product. You can also introduce a new product line. Many companies usually do better with the second product than the first campaign. This helps increase the annual revenue for companies.</p>
				    		<li><b>Better position yourself for BIGGER deals</b></li>
				    			<p>Once you deliver a successful crowdfunding campaign, you have proved that there is a high demand for your product which will help you close larger volume deals direct with retailers or accelerate potential licensing. You can take advantage of your success for future press as well because crowdfunding is social by nature. Your success will always live on the social media platform because of the advertisement it`s received from its community.</p>
