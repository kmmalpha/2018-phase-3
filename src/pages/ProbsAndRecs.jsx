    		    <h1>Problems And Recommendations</h1>
    		    <h3>Problems</h3>
					<p><b>Categorised Responsibility:</b> Service planning and delivery for resources such water, sewer, roads and storm drainage, electricity, rests with a number of different departments and thus delivery can lead to inefficiencies unless there is substantial co-ordination at all stages of the project planning, budgeting and administration cycle.</p>
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>
					<p><b>Improve Co-ordination Arrangements:</b> In planning and implementing infrastructure upgrading works covering a number of sub-sectors in heavily populated dense areas international experience has shown that planning and carrying out the works together better ensures compatibility of proposals. It enables works to be carried out more quickly, and avoids continued disruption to the beneficiary communities due to services improvements being carried out at different times.</p>
					<p><b>Involve Communities:</b> Recognising the importance of the communities and involving them at key stages of projects planning and implementation of upgrading initiatives further reduces the possibility of continued disruption in communities during an upgrading project. The use of contractors formed out of the community will assist in the co-ordination as well as providing employment opportunities.</p>
					<h2>Other Services</h2>
					<h3>Problems</h3>
					<p><b>Low Water Pressure:</b> Because of the high population, there is a demand for water which exceeds system design capacity. This results in low pressures at peak times.</p>
					<p><b>Dangerous Electrical Connections:</b> There appear to be many illegal connections to the electricity supply system. Sub-stations are insecure and present a considerable danger to children with easy access available (e.g. doors to metal ground level units open) where it appears that "hot-wiring" has occurred.</p>
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>
					<p>Improvements to Water Supply Main: Consideration is being given by GMJC to the laying of a new supply line into Alex to increase quantity and pressure and it is understood that consultants are to be appointed to plan and design a rehabilitation program. It would be important to ensure that those planning and designing sewerage system rehabilitation lease closely with those designing the water supply system rehabilitation. Ideally planning and designing would be more efficient and easier to co-ordinate if carried out by the same team.</p>
				<h2>River Banks</h2>
				<h3>Problems</h3>
					<p><b>Informal Settlements Below Flood Line:</b> Many of those shacks (3'000+ families) constructed along the banks of the Jukskei river are in danger in times of flood. Relocation of all those below appropriate flood lines would  appear to be unavoidable.</p>
					<p><b>Pollution of River:</b> The settlements along the banks are significant polluters of the river.</p>
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>
					<p><b>Relocate to East Bank Developments:</b> Those to be relocated should be resettled in East Bank, NOT to remote locations which would likely lead to their return along the river banks of the Jukskei river.</p>
					<p><b>Protect Cleared Areas:</b> As part of the relocation plan, arrangements should be put in place immediately for the areas that are cleared to protect the areas and to avoid further squatting. Recreational areas, service roads, and the proposed zonal interceptor sewer alignments are future functional uses for West Bank.</p>
